### Manifest File Format

#### Documentation for manifest file

The manifest file specifies the location of the files that will be processed by the metabolomicsgnps plugin. It is a .CSV formatted table that contains two columns (See Figure X below). The first column indicates the ‘sample-id’ for each file, while the second column indicates its corresponding relative file path (relative to where qiime commands are called). The gnps-clustering and the mzmine2-clustering tools are using both the same manifest file. The example file can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/mwang87/q2_metabolomicsgnps/raw/master/q2_metabolomicsgnps/tests/data/manifest.tsv)
